Iâ€™ve been honing my craft since 2022, turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions. After all, why complicate things when you can simplify themâ€”and make them bug-free? When Iâ€™m not immersed in code, you can catch me at the gym, lifting more than just weights (though Iâ€™ll admit, I do love a good challenge). And if Iâ€™m out for a walk in the park, I might look like Iâ€™m deep in thought, but really, Iâ€™m just trying to remember if I left my coffee on the desk.",

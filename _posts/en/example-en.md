# Showcasing the Features of My Next.js Portfolio Blog

Welcome to this comprehensive tour of my portfolio blog built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. This post will demonstrate various Markdown features and custom components that make this blog stand out.


## Table of Contents

## Rich Text Formatting

First, let's look at some basic text formatting:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for slight emphasis
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for outdated information
- `Inline code` for short code snippets

## Headings

### This is an H3 Heading

#### This is an H4 Heading

##### This is an H5 Heading

###### This is an H6 Heading

## Lists

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Subitem 3.1
   2. Subitem 3.2

## Code Blocks

Here's a JavaScript code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```
